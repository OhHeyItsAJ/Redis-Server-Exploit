# Redis-Server-Exploit
This will give you shell access on the target system if redis server is not configured properly and faced on the internet without any authentication. This script can be used to make keys for a list of users taken as an argument and attempt top make an SSH connection.

# Disclaimer
This exploit is purely intended for educational purposes. I do not want anyone to use this exploit to actually hack into computers or do other illegal things. So I cannot be held responsible for any illegal purposes. If you don’t agree, then you are not allowed to use/run/see the exploit… so leave it immediately..

# Usage
The script will take in an IP and text file of users as required arguments.
`python3 redis.py 127.0.0.1 user.txt`

Optionally, ports other than defaults can be specified for both redis and SSH via optional arguments respectively.
`python3 redis.py 127.0.0.1 user.txt -p 66379 -s 2222`
